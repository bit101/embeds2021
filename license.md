This is not really a license per se. But here's the deal. I put this code out here publicly so you can see it and learn from it. Feel free to take the concepts you see here and use them elsewhere. You can even copy and paste parts of the code into your own projects. You can do that in your work projects, client projects, etc. All good.

What you can't do is copy and paste the entirety of the code into your project, change a couple of variables and put it out as your own. If you want to use some existing image here in some commercial project, get in touch and we'll work out an agreement. If it's some kind of non-profit or school project, get in touch and I'll probably give you the ok to use it.

You may absolutely not create and sell an NFT based entirely on the code for any project here.
